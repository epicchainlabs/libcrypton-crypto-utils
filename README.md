## üì¶ Getting Started

To explore and utilize the capabilities of **libcrypton-crypto-utils**, you can use the `crypdev` command-line tool included with the library. Below are detailed instructions to get started.

### üîß Building the Library and Tool

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/epicchainlabs/libcrypton-crypto-utils.git
   cd libcrypton-crypto-utils
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   
   **For Linux:** Ensure you have the necessary dependencies such as `openssl` and `gtest`. These are managed as submodules.

   - Initialize and update submodules:
     ```bash
     git submodule update --init --recursive
     ```
   - Install `libgmp-dev` for C++ native implementation:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev
     ```

3. **Build the Library and Tool:**

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

   This will compile the library and build the `crypdev` tool, placing the executable in `./bin/crypdev`.

### üõ†Ô∏è Using `crypdev`

`crypdev` is a powerful command-line tool that allows you to interact with the cryptographic functions provided by **libcrypton-crypto-utils**. Here's a glimpse of what you can do with it:

- **Hashing Data:**
  
  ```bash
  ./bin/crypdev
  ```

  ```

  ```

- **Generating Keys:**

  ```bash
  > set ecc secp256r1
  CURVE SET TO 'secp256r1'

  > gen ecc keypair
  public key (compressed format): 037c50d797720fefe9194ecd5b4ef3c25b3791abb45639aa8453d110bae08a945a
